          India is facing continuing instability in a Himalayan flashpoint. The region of Aksai Chin has long been contested by India and China and was the site of deadly clashes between the two Asian powers three years ago.

Satellite images taken in the six months from October 2022 show a region increasingly in flux. Where once there were scattered People’s Liberation Army (PLA) checkpoints and rudimentary positions on the Chinese side of the poorly demarcated Line of Actual Control, now there is an established Chinese presence.
Claimed by New Delhi as part of Ladakh but administered by Beijing as part of Xinjiang and Tibet, Aksai Chin is home to the Galwan Valley, where 20 Indian soldiers and at least four Chinese soldiers died in a clash in June 2020. As both sides still disagree about the border’s precise location, the danger of an accidental clash escalating into a Sino-Indian crisis between the two nuclear powers is very much present.

For India, this means its armed forces will now have to match a large-scale and probably semi-permanent Chinese presence along the border with Aksai Chin, perhaps for years to come.

        UN slams civilian toll as Russia's war in Ukraine reaches day 500
While this year the casualty numbers have been lower on average than in 2022, the figure began to climb again in May and June, the monitors noted. On June 27, 13 civilians, including four children, were killed in a missile strike on Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine. And far from the front line in the western city of Lviv, at least five people were killed and another 37 were wounded during a bombing early Thursday that the mayor called the biggest attack on civilian infrastructure since the invasion began.

        NATO allies are expected to increase military support for Ukraine to boost the slow-moving counteroffensive against Russia. According to Kiel Institute for the World Economy, EU and NATO allies have provided Kyiv with €102 billion ($112 billion) in military aid between February 2022 and May 2023. The US made up almost half of this total, providing € 43 billion.

            Heat oil in a (14- to 16-inch) paella pan or a large, deep skillet over
            medium-high heat. Add chicken, shrimp and chorizo, and cook, stirring
            occasionally until lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer shrimp to a
            large plate and set aside, leaving chicken and chorizo in the pan. Add
            pimentón, bay leaves, garlic, tomatoes, onion, salt and pepper, and cook,
            stirring often until thickened and fragrant, about 10 minutes. Add
            saffron broth and remaining 4 1/2 cups chicken broth; bring to a boil.

          <Typography paragraph>
            Add rice and stir very gently to distribute. Top with artichokes and
            peppers, and cook without stirring, until most of the liquid is absorbed,
            15 to 18 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, add reserved shrimp and
            mussels, tucking them down into the rice, and cook again without
            stirring, until mussels have opened and rice is just tender, 5 to 7
            minutes more. (Discard any mussels that don&apos;t open.)
